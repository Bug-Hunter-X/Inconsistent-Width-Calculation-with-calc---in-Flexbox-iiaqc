The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon issue related to the `calc()` function and percentage values within a `flex` context:

```css
.container {
display: flex;
width: 100%;
}

.item {
width: calc(50% - 10px);
background-color: lightblue;
}
```

The expected behavior is that two `.item` elements within the `.container` would each occupy 45% of the available space (50% minus 10px margin), leaving a 10px gap between them.  However, this calculation may not always be accurate due to rounding errors and how `calc()` interacts with percentage units within a flexible layout.
