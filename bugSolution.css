A more reliable approach is to avoid `calc()` with percentages directly and instead handle the width adjustments with a different strategy.  For example, using the `gap` property on the flex container is often a cleaner and more predictable solution:

```css
.container {
display: flex;
width: 100%;
gap: 10px;
}

.item {
width: 50%;
background-color: lightblue;
}
```

This method eliminates the need for `calc()` and ensures the 10px gap between items is consistently maintained.  Alternatively, you could use grid layout which offers more precise control over spacing.
